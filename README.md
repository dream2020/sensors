_DREAM sensors_ is an integrated sensor system developed within the European research project [DREAM: Development of Robot-Enhanced therapy for children with AutisM spectrum disorders](http://www.dream2020.eu).
This software is part of a complete system for Robot Enhanced Therapy (RET), available at [github.com/dream2020/DREAM](https://github.com/dream2020/DREAM).

The functionality and theory behind _DREAM sensors_ is presented in detail in several academic publications, please see the list of references below.
